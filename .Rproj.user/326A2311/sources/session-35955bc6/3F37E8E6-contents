# LapseRiskASS

##### Lapse risk modelling in insurance: a Bayesian mixture approach
##### Authors: Viviana G R Lobo, Thais C O Fonseca and Mariane B Alves


Bayesian Survival models via mixture of Log-Normal distribution extends the well-known survival models accommodating different behaviour over time and considers higher censored survival times. The proposal combines mixture distributions Fruhwirth-Schnatter(2006) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-009-9121-4>, and data augmentation techniques Tanner and Wong (1987) <https://doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1987.10478458>.
